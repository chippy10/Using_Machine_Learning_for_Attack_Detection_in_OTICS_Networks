# Using_Machine_Learning_for_Attack_Detection_in_OT/ICS_Networks

The increasing number of cyberattacks on OT/ICS in recent years has raised security concerns due to the potential for productivity disruption and financial losses. The industrial environment requires robust machine learning models to detect MitM, DDoS, IP-Scan, Port-Scan, Reply, Injection, and masquerade attacks. Existing machine learning models use outdated or unrealistic network data to detect attacks Although there are a few commonly used datasets, they do not reflect real network data and lack the ability to detect attacks, This project utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms and two datasets from different ICS/OT environments, namely the Power System Attack and ICS-Flow datasets. It proposes using KNN, LR, J48, RF, SVM, XGBoost, and ANN algorithms to detect attacks. In ICS-Flow, the algorithm with the highest accuracy is ANN, with 99.99%. However, XGBoost performs the best with 85% accuracy in the Power System Attack. The resulting model can potentially be used for intrusion detection in the OT/ICS environment, Moreover, it will be based on IDS.
